Covered in snow year-round, it resembles a giant dragon lying among the clouds. The mountain has several scenic areas, including the Glacier Park where visitors can take a large cable car to reach the glacier at an altitude of 4,506 meters and admire the spectacular thousand-year-old glacier up close. Blue Moon Valley&apos;s lakes display a dreamlike blue color, earning it the name &quot;Blue Moon.&quot; Spruce Meadow is an alpine meadow on the mountainside, covered with flowers in summer and grazed by cattle and sheep. Ganhaizi is a must-pass area on the way to the snow mountain and is an excellent spot for viewing and photographing the mountain. Due to the high altitude, visitors should be aware of altitude sickness when visiting the mountain. It is recommended to arrive in Lijiang one day in advance to acclimate and to supplement with oxygen appropriately while on the mountain.
